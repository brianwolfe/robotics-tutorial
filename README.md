This website is intended to allow people to interact with and
learn about various filter types using intuitive graphical
representations. As of now, it includes basic tutorials for
only the following filter types:

* Kalman Filter
* Information Filter

I'm in the process of building tutorials for the following
types of processes:

* Extended Kalman Filter
* Unscented Kalman Filter
* Histogram Filter
* Particle Filter
