          As an example system, consider a cart on a track. The cart has
          a radar that measures the distance to a target at the end of the
          track and encoders on its wheels to measure the incremental distance
          along the track. We power it using a small motor and it is
          buffetted by wind and imperfections in the tracks. This is depicted
          in the graphic below:
          </p>
          <p>
          At each timestep, $t$, we attempt to estimate the position of the cart
          along the track, $d_t$.
          We start off with an estimate of where the cart is along the track,
          quantified using the our prior distribution $p(d_0)$. At each timestep,
          we will perform two steps. First, we will estimate where we think the
          cart is based on the incremental wheel encoder readings using a state
          update step, then we
          will update that estimate based on the radar measurement using a 
          measurement update step.
          </p>
          <h3> State update </h3>
          We will represent our belief that the cart is at distance $d$ from the
          sensor as a probability distribution. Consider the following probability
          distributions:
          <ul>
            <li>
            If we start out knowing exactly where the cart is, the
            probability distribution of possible positions of the
            cart at time $t$ as a narrow spike, indicating that it is likely to
            be at our estimate, and unlikely to be at any other position. This is
            indicated by the "localized" distribution in the graph below.
            </li>
            <li>
            If we think we know where the cart is, but have some uncertainty about it,
            we would expect an even wider distribution, as shown in the "moderate"
            distribution in the graph below.
            </li>
            <li>
            If we have very little idea where the cart is, we could assign a very
            broad distribution to our belief in the position of the cart, indicating
            that it really could be anywhere along the track. This is shown in the
            delocalized distribution in the graph.

          <p>
          Next, consider what happens at time $t = 1$ if we measure (via the encoders)
          that the cart has moved 5 meters to the right along the track. How would each
          of the distributions above change (suppose the track is infinitely long).
          </p>
          <p>
          If our wheel encoders measured the incremental distance perfectly, we would
          our new position to be our old position plus one meter so we should expect
          that each new distribution at time $t = 1$ is a copy of the distribution
          at time $t = 0$, shifted to the right by 5 meters.
          </p>
          <div id="movement1">
          </div>
          <p>
          Whenever we move, however, our uncertainty about where we are will tend to
          increase. Systematic errors, such as uncertainty in our wheel diameter and
          random errors, such as wheel slippage, will both contribute to the error
          after moving by 5 meters. A more realistic model would widen the probability
          distribution after each timestep, as below. You can play around with the
          magnitude of the noise using the Noise STD box.
          <div id="noisymovement">
          </div>
          Observe that whatever value of noise you use, each step to the right
          shifts the peak of the distribution by 5 meters. Larger values
          of noise correspond to less accurate measurements by the
          wheel encoders. Smaller values of noise correspond to more
          accurate measurements by the wheel encoders. The noise cannot
          be negative, that is, we cannot gain more information from
          the state update step. You can see this because even if we
          move with 0 noise, none of the peaks get more narrow after
          movement. This makes sense, if we don't know where we start
          from, even if we know we moved exactly 5 meters, we have
          the same level of uncertainty in our final position as we
          did in our initial position.
          <p>
          The corresponding equations for the state update step
          are straightforward. We have a single state variable, the
          position $d_t$, and at each timestep we are moving from the
          previous position $d_{t - 1}$ by a specific
          distance $\Delta d_t$ subject to a specific amount of noise
          $\epsilon^d_t$. This can be written:
          \[d_{t} = d_{t - 1} + \Delta d_t + \epsilon^d_t\].
          In the example above, $\Delta d_t$ was chosen to be 5 m and
          $\epsilon^d_t$ was a gaussian random variable with the standard
          deviation specified in the input box.
          <p>
          We can now quantify what our confidence in where the cart is
          after each movement step. We will now use a measurement update
          step to determine the cart position more precisely. In 
          this step, we take a single measurement and update the
          cart position distribution based on our uncertainty in the
          measurement value and our uncertainty in the carts position.

          We can model this system using the following difference equations:
          \[d_t = d_{t - 1} + \Delta t \cdot v_{t - 1} + \frac{1}{2} (\Delta t)^2 a_{t}\]
          \[v_t = v_{t - 1} + \Delta t \cdot a_{t}\]
          where $a_t$ is an applied acceleration, determined by the total force on
          the cart, $f_t$, and the mass of the cart $m$. The total force is a sum of
          the control, $u_t$, and the noise, $f^\epsilon_t$. This gives us the following
          difference equations:
          \[d_t = d_{t - 1} + \Delta t \cdot v_{t - 1} + \frac{1}{2 m} (\Delta t)^2 u_{t} + \frac{1}{2 m} (\Delta t^2) f^{\epsilon}_t)\]
          \[v_t = v_{t - 1} + \Delta t \cdot \frac{u_{t}}{m} + \Delta t \cdot \frac{f^{\epsilon}_t}{m}\]
          The distance sensor gives us the estimated position at each time $t$, with an added
          noise $\delta_t$.
          \[z_t = d_t + \delta_t\]
          Our goal is to estimate the position and velocity of the cart using a Kalman filter.
          </p>
          <p>
          For this filter, our state vector contains the position and velocity:
          \[x_t = \left[\begin{array}{c} d_t \\ v_t \end{array}\right]\].
          </p>
          <p>
          The first half of the Kalman filter predicts the position after the next timestep
          using the difference equations specified above:
          \[x_t \approx \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \Delta t \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]x_{t-1} + \left[\begin{array}{c} \frac{(\Delta t)^2}{2m} \\ \frac{\Delta t}{m} \end{array}\right] u_t + \left[\begin{array}{c} \epsilon^d_t \\ \epsilon^v_t \end{array}\right] \]
          Where 
          \[A = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \Delta t \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] \]
          extrapolates the previous state forward,
          \[B = \left[\begin{array}{c} \frac{(\Delta t)^2}{2m} \\ \frac{\Delta t}{m} \end{array}\right]\]
          maps the control input $u_t$ to changes in the state variables,
          and 
          \[R = \left[\begin{array}{c} \epsilon^d_t \\ \epsilon^v_t \end{array}\right] \]
          is the contribution of noise to the changes in state variables.
