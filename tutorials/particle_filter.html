        The particle filter attempts to represent the probability
        distribution directly through sampling. Regions of higher
        probability are populated with more particles. Regions of
        lower probability are depleted of particles. The particle
        filter has several important properties:
        <ul>
          <li> Unlike the Gaussian filters, no assumption is made
              on the form of the distribution. A particle filter can often
              track multimodal, complex distributions more accurately than
              a Gaussian filter if enough particles are used.
          <li> The computational cost and accuracy can be traded off: more
              particles will give a more accurate depiction of the true
              distribution, but will take more storage and computational power
              to track.
        </ul>

        The 2.5D robot on a track demo is shown below. Particles are
        represented by small semi-transparent dots with lines
        indicating the heading. The mean and covariance of the particles
        are shown as a covariance ellipse with the mean heading in
        dark blue and the one standard deviation depicted in light
        blue. 
        
        Change the encoder readings and click move to propagate forward.
        After each movement step, each particle is propagated forward by
        the amount indicated by the encoder readings plus some sampled
        that is distributed according to the matrix $Q$.
        
        Click on the plot to sample a measurement at a particular location.
        The measurement will resample the particles, weighted by the relative
        likelihood derived from Bayes rule.
